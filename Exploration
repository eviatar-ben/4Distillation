1.  CANCELLED-TOTALLY_WRONG
    To make the Mappers learn the "clip Encoder outputs Embeddings" only (what now is called bypass )
    and not the "clip Encoder inputs Embeddings" : Since in view_neti they learned the "clip Encoder inputs Embeddings"
    to achive cross attension (which occurs inside the clip Encoder).

2.  To check the SD Unet layers thats are learned (maybe they are fits specifically to SD 2.1).

3. Adding Positional Encoding to the IPAdapters Images.

4. Changing the time token <t> to relative time  to the IPAdapter images

5. Change The Randomness in the IPAdapter images sample

6. To drop the IPAdapter images in some iteration
